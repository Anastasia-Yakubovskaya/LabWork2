### System Description

The system is an analog of a card RPG game in which players build villages on a 20x20 grid. At the beginning of the game, each player chooses one of the characteristics that affects their actions during the game:
- Player Characteristics:

- Natural disasters deal 20% less damage.

- Building structures costs 10% less.

### Game Mechanics

### Player's Turn

- Cell Selection:

- The player selects from one to three cells for construction.

- Drawing Cards:

- The player draws cards from the Construction deck. The number of cards is calculated as:

     \[

     \text{Number of cards} = 3 - \text{Number of selected cells}

     \]

- Construction:

- The player builds structures on the grid. If there are more structures than free cells, the remaining cards stay "in hand."

- Random Event:

- The player draws a card from the Randomness deck and plays it.

- Dice Roll:

- The player rolls a die. If a 5 or 6 is rolled, the player draws a card from the Bonus deck.

- Using a Bonus Card:

- The player may play a card from the Bonus deck.

### Card Decks

- Construction:

- Cards for buildings, trees, and water.

- Randomness:

- Cards for natural disasters and economic crises.

- Bonus Cards:

- Allow the player to avoid the consequences of cards from the Randomness deck or gain bonus points.

### Interaction with Other Players

- From the Bonus deck, the player can draw a card that allows them to:

- Declare war on an opponent.

- Take cards from them.

### End of Game

- The game ends when all cells are occupied.

- The player with the highest score wins.
